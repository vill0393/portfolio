# Fernando's Portfolio

## Current Status
##Background (How you created your web portfolio)
We started creating a portfolio in the UXD class. At that time I didn't have any idea we would be using it for the Web Dev assignment. The layout was inspired by the the logo since both colours and fonts were taken from there. Some elements such as the collage and my profile pic are suppose to mantaing a proportion related to the letter F in the logo. It was necessary to do some changes to my mock-ups before starting this assignment to facilitate the process since the firs design I made for UXD class was kind of complicated to code because it had some irregular margins and I think I am still not in that point where I can code something like that. The work section was solved by using the grid system, dividing the format in two columns where the left one could hold the text explaining how the visuals were created, and the right one the image, and once you start scrolling down the order switches depending on the row you are in. I understand it is not the most appealing thing to do visually speaking; however, I was happy to be able to understand a bit better how the grid system works. 

### Challenges Faced
Everything from Web Dev is a challenge to me since I find it kind of complicated;
1. The use of grid system.
2. To solve all media queries by using same images.
3. Styling the contact form (took me a while to figure out what was the error CSS validator was showing)


### Overcoming challenges
It was great to see I was able to code this project. Although I still have to go to my notes and class videos in order to remember or better understand what I am doing, I feel it was a less stresfull experience than the mid-term assignment, which means I am starting to assimilate all this information a bit better.

##What I learned
- I learned to move the elements in the grid system by indicating the start of the columns and rows. (I know we learned this before but was not clear to me).
- The use of media queries. I know we can start by using max or min width. Sounds silly but it was not clear to me what the difference was. After this assignment and the lessons taken in the second term, I feel I understand better how to apply them.
- How to build two different styles of navigation bar. Also the hover and active status.
- How to insert social media icons. (I only used the Facebook icon, and it's the first time I did it so a bit of research help me to see it was as easy as inserting an email icon.)
- Opening a link in a new page (facebook icon).
- Styling the contact form. In the previous assignments I kept getting some errors in the contact form. Finally figured out I was wrongly placing and id in both label and input.

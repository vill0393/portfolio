                <h3>EDITORIAL</h3>
                <p>This cover was part of a redesign I did for a newspaper, from the logo to the overall layout. I learned a lot from my teacher who was advising me throughout the project because it was my first time working on an editorial project.</p>

            <div class="logo">
                <h3>LOGO</h3>
                <p>I designed this logo for a restaurant located in Ottawa. The owners wanted to develope an idea where corn was the main inspiration. After some research we found out an illustration of the prehispanic Corn Goddess, which is wearing a belt with a symbol on it, which was incorporated in the logo.</p>

                <h3>ILLUSTRATION</h3>
                <p>I did this illustration in the Digital Graphics class. The idea was to creat an avatar, where we could put in practice our best Adobe Illustrator skills, by using gradients, textures and complex backgrounds.</p>

                <p>This is one of the first posters I designed a while ago; there was a poster contest for a children's book fair so I decided to participate. Although the poster was not the winner, I received an honorable mention and the poster was exhibited in the main gallery of the fair.</p>

                <h3>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
                <p>I took a photography course during the first semester of the IMD program. During one of the assignments, I decided to take some pictures of the museums in Ottawa and Gatineau. I chose the one from the Museum of History to be my favorite.</p>

                <h3>PERSONAL PROJECT</h3>
                <p>I have always found feathers fascinating. Perhaps because of their various shapes, colors and textures, so I decided to illustrate some of them. At that time I didn't have a digital tablet, so I made the drawings by hand and then scanned them so I could vectorize them in Adobe Illustrator. In the future I plan to print them on t-shirts and mugs.</p>
